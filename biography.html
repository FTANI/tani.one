        learning something new.</br>

        I'm an Engineer with an <span class="txtHighlight">MBA</span> and I've been working in the <span class="txtHighlight">Telecom</span> industry for more than 13 years (as of 2018), delivering tangible results in several roles for relevant technical subjects in LATAM market such as the adoption of 1xEVDO, WCDMA, LTE, the dawn of the touchscreen phones, the differentiation through a Digital Eco-system, Widgets and App Development just to highlight the most relevant accomplishments.</br>

        My career began as an intern, working for ABB and designing Dry-type resin encapsulated transformers as powerful as 2MVA.
    </p>

    <p id="okakougiTxt">
        While I was working for ABB I was offered the opportunity to go to <span class="txtHighlight">Japan</span> and do an internship in a <span class="txtHighlight">Technology Consulting</span> company ran by the Okayama prefecture.</br>
        </br>
         The company's name is Industrial Technology Center of Okayama Prefecture (岡山県工業技術センター)

    <p id="vivoTxt">
        I started working with Telecommunications through the <span class="txtHighlight">Vivo Trainee program</span> back in 2004, which allowed me to do a job-rotation inside the company. Vivo is a <span class="txtHighlight">Telefónica Group</span> mobile operator in Brazil.</br>
         </br>
        After the Trainee program had finished, I chose the Handset Innovation Team to be my final assignment as there was a perfect match between my skills and interests with the responsibilities and needs of the <span class="txtHighlight">Product Marketing Manager</span> position.</br>
        </br>
        I was responsible for the launch of various devices inside Vivo, devices such as the LG M4410, Motorola Razr V3, Nokia N97, Sony Ericsson K850 and W810 among others.</br>
        </br>
        Then I became responsible for both <span class="txtHighlight">Creation and Analysis</span> of <span class="txtHighlight">Technical Specifications</span>, <span class="txtHighlight">Product Debugging</span> and <span class="txtHighlight">Product Roadmap</span> analysis for all vendors and for any given quarter to select the models with the best fit to the operator's <span class="txtHighlight">Marketing Strategy</span>.</br>
        </br>
        I was responsible for the <span class="txtHighlight">acceptance</span> phase of <span class="txtHighlight">data cards</span> from numerous vendors into the Vivo's network, such as G-Tran, Sierra, and Kyocera.           
    </p>
